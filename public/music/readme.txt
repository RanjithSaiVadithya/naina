# Music Files

This directory is intended for storing audio files for the website.

For demonstration purposes, the current implementation uses audio placeholders from external sources 
to ensure there are no copyright issues. In a real implementation, you would place your actual MP3 files here
and update the paths in the MusicPlayer component.

## How to add your own music:

1. Place your MP3 files in this directory
2. Update the path in src/components/MusicPlayer.jsx to point to your local file:
   - For example: `const musicUrl = "/music/your-song.mp3";`

## Note on Usage

Make sure you have the rights to use any music files included in this project.
